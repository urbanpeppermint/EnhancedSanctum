# Sanctum

**A Mindfulness & Breathwork Experience for Snap Spectacles (2024)**

Sanctum is an immersive spatial computing application that combines guided breathing practices, chakra-tuned binaural frequencies, and generative AI visuals to create a portable meditation sanctuary. Built for Snap Spectacles 2024 using Lens Studio 5.14+.

---

## Overview

After extensive research into meditation practices, sound healing frequencies, and visual relaxation techniques, Sanctum emerged as a comprehensive mindfulness tool that leverages spatial computing to create calming experiences anywhere, anytime.

The project integrates:
- **AI-Generated Zen Environments**: DALL-E 3 creates unique, calming nature scenes and abstract spaces
- **Guided Breathing Practice**: GPT-4o generates personalized 1-minute breathing exercises with natural voice guidance
- **Chakra-Tuned Frequencies**: Seven distinct binaural beat frequencies corresponding to each chakra center
- **Non-Invasive Visual Meditation**: Animated geometric patterns that provide focal points without eye strain or photosensitivity triggers

---

## Features

### 1. Guided Breathing Practice
- **AI-Generated Scripts**: Each session creates unique, contextually-aware breathing guidance
- **Natural Voice Synthesis**: Calm, therapeutic voice using OpenAI's TTS (Coral voice)
- **Structured Breathwork**: 4-4-6 breathing pattern (inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 6s) repeated across 3 cycles
- **Real-time Phase Display**: Visual text cues synchronized with breathing phases

### 2. Generative Zen Spaces
- **Dynamic Environment Generation**: AI creates unique calming visuals per session
  - Peaceful forest scenes with morning light
  - Serene mountain lakes at dawn
  - Abstract flowing water patterns
  - Misty bamboo forests
  - Zen gardens with raked sand
  - Gentle ocean waves at sunset
- **2D to Spatial Transformation**: Images spatialize into immersive 3D environments
- **Persistent Visual Meditation**: Spaces remain available for continued contemplation

### 3. Chakra Frequency Library
Seven distinct binaural beat frequencies, each tuned to resonate with specific chakra centers:

| Chakra | Frequency | Properties |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Root (Muladhara) | 396 Hz | Grounding, stability, security |
| Sacral (Svadhisthana) | 417 Hz | Creativity, emotional balance |
| Solar Plexus (Manipura) | 528 Hz | Personal power, transformation |
| Heart (Anahata) | 639 Hz | Love, compassion, connection |
| Throat (Vishuddha) | 741 Hz | Expression, communication |
| Third Eye (Ajna) | 852 Hz | Intuition, insight, clarity |
| Crown (Sahasrara) | 963 Hz | Spiritual connection, transcendence |

### 4. Geometric Visual Meditation
- **Non-Photosensitive Animation**: Carefully designed animated geometric patterns
- **Flicker-Free Design**: Smooth, continuous motion without harsh strobing or rapid flashing
- **Hypnotic Flow**: Trippy, mandala-like patterns that facilitate meditative focus
- **Eye-Safe Implementation**: Tested to avoid triggering photosensitive responses or eye strain

## Research & Design Decisions

### Breathing Pattern Selection
The 4-4-6 pattern was chosen after reviewing multiple breathwork methodologies:
- **Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)**: Military/tactical use, alertness
- **4-7-8 Technique**: Dr. Andrew Weil's sleep method
- **4-4-6 Pattern**: Optimal for active stress reduction while maintaining engagement

The 4-4-6 pattern extends the exhale phase, activating the parasympathetic nervous system more effectively than equal-count methods, while remaining accessible to beginners.

### Frequency Selection Rationale
Chakra frequencies are based on the Solfeggio scale and Pythagorean tuning systems. While scientific evidence for chakra-frequency correspondence remains anecdotal, these frequencies align with:
- Traditional Vedic chakra associations
- Modern sound healing practices
- Harmonic resonance principles
- User-reported subjective experiences in meditation contexts

**Note**: This feature is offered as a complementary wellness tool, not as medical treatment.

### Visual Safety Protocol
Animated geometric patterns underwent careful design to avoid:
- **Photosensitive epilepsy triggers**: No rapid flashing (kept below 3 Hz variation)
- **Eye strain**: Smooth animations, moderate contrast ratios
- **Motion sickness**: Gentle, predictable movement patterns
- **Overwhelming stimulation**: Balanced complexity, calming color palettes

private breathingPhases = [
  { phase: "inhale", duration: 4, text: "Breathe in..." },
  { phase: "hold", duration: 4, text: "Hold gently..." },
  { phase: "exhale", duration: 6, text: "Breathe out..." },
  { phase: "pause", duration: 2, text: "Notice the stillness..." }
];
```

### Adjusting Voice Tone
Modify `voiceInstructions` parameter:
```typescript
private voiceInstructions: string = 
  "Wise zen master tone. Calm, grounding voice. Speak slowly.";
```

### Zen Visual Themes
Add new visual themes in `createZenSpacePrompt()`:
```typescript
const prompts = [
  "Your custom DALL-E prompt here...",
  // Add more variations
];
```

### Frequency Tuning
Replace audio files with alternative frequencies or binaural beat configurations matching your research preferences.

## Known Limitations

- **API Latency**: Voice and image generation depend on network connectivity and OpenAI API response times
- **Battery Consumption**: AI generation and spatial rendering are battery-intensive operations
- **Frequency Effectiveness**: Subjective experiences with chakra frequencies vary by individual
- **Visual Preferences**: Not all users respond equally to abstract geometric animations

## Future Development

Potential enhancements under consideration:
- [ ] Offline mode with pre-generated content
- [ ] User-customizable breathing patterns

## Safety & Disclaimers

**Medical Disclaimer**: Sanctum is a wellness tool, not medical treatment. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition. Users with respiratory conditions, anxiety disorders, or other health concerns should consult healthcare professionals before beginning any breathwork practice.

**Photosensitivity Warning**: While designed to minimize risk, individuals with photosensitive epilepsy should use caution with geometric animations. Discontinue use if experiencing discomfort, disorientation, or unusual visual phenomena.

**Frequency Therapy**: Claims about chakra frequencies and their effects are based on traditional practices and anecdotal reports, not peer-reviewed scientific evidence. Use as a complementary relaxation tool, not as primary medical intervention.

**Spatial Awareness**: Always practice in safe environments where you can sit or stand comfortably. Do not use while driving, operating machinery, or in situations requiring full attention to surroundings.
